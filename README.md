# MontyHall
This project simulates the Monty Hall problem with the option to switch doors or to not switch doors when asked. By a brute force method, we see that after many games played, switching doors will yield more games won than not switching doors. A description of the Monty Hall problem can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">here</a>.
